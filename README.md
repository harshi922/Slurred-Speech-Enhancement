# Slurred-Speech-Enhancement
The prevalence of dysarthria as one of the most common speech pathologies makes Automatic Speech Recognition of said slurred speech error prone. This is a consequence of the high variability in the patientsâ€™ speech which makes generalization systems the need of the hour. Thus, we propose Enhancing Slurred Speech using deep learning by adopting a one shot learning framework. We aim to study the feasibility and applications in a generalized enhancement system in accessibility concerns of the patients.
